[In this blog post](https://medium.com/rocket-travel/why-we-chose-lambdamart-for-our-hotel-ranking-model-45f84e22cec), I talk about LambdaMART, a listwise ranking model based on gradient boosting which has been used in [AirBnB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09591.pdf) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/from-ranknet-to-lambdarank-to-lambdamart-an-overview/). What is its objective function optimizing for? How can we update it to handle display bias? And in what situation would you use it over a collaborative filtering approach?
