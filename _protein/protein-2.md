[This was a paper](../../files/the_call_article.pdf) I wrote as a freshman undergraduate which ended up becoming the leading article in Stern's annual ["Call for Corporate Action" publication](https://issuu.com/corporateaction/docs/thecall_nyustern_2017) ([mirror here](../../files/the_call.pdf)). My research for the paper is where I first got interested in the quantitative sciences - before that, I was fully intent on pursuing a path of "business" and "entrepreneurship" (whatever that meant to my addled freshman mind). It's a quaint and nostalgic experience to read my past opinions, so I like keeping this around as a reminder of where I came from. 

Special thanks to the editors: Professor Jeffrey Younger, Stephanie Kim, Dorit Sosnowik, and Catherine O'Connor, as well as Kelly Xie who did the graphic design and Jing Hao who took the photographs for the publication.
