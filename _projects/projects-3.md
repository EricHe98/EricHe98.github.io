The problem of protein folding is centered around understanding how the chain
of amino acids comprising a protein folds into its stable, low-energy conformation. Because the laws of physics which govern the process are well-defined,
protein folding can be simulated on computers. However, doing so requires a
tremendous amount of computation and generates a large amount of folding
data.
This paper explains how to build Markov State Models to analyze protein
folding data. As a form of probabilistic graph, Markov State Models can be
used to process folding data generated from molecular dynamics data into a
human-interpretable representation. Under the Markov State Model framework,
protein folding is viewed as a probabilistic process rather than a deterministic
one, and uncertainty around estimates can be quantified and used to focus
simulation efforts to reduce the number of computations needed by two orders
of magnitude.
