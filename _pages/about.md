About Me
======
- I work as a data scientist at [Rocketmiles](https://www.rocketmiles.com), a subsidiary of [Booking Holdings](https://www.bookingholdings.com/). We sell hotel rooms online, and give you back gift cards, airline miles or reward points for booking with us. 
- I'm currently doing a master's degree at the NYU Center for Data Science (2019-exp. 2022). My undergraduate degree was also at NYU (2015-2019), where I obtained a degree in business at the Stern School of (you guessed it) Business, and a math major and computer science minor at the Courant mathematical institute.
- Feel free to connect with me on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-he/).
- I made this website by forking the [academic-pages repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on Github. Great and easy to use - would recommend!
